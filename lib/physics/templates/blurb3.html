<h2>We run these observations through seven million lines of code, using the laws of physics to predict the future</h2>

<p>Our team of 500 scientist and programmers write computer programs (what we call a model - ours has more than 7 million lines of code!) solving the physics equations which let us predict the future from observations.</p>

<p>Our model code is so complex that we need a supercomputer to run it. Our latest supercomputer is one of the most powerful in the world and is able to perform more than 16,000 trillion calculations per second (plus, at 140 tonnes, weighs the equivalent of 11 double decker buses!)</p>

<p>The data that comes out of our models and supercomputer is displayed and interpreted to create the weather forecasts that you see every day but, and this is a very important step, we also compare and verify our forecast data against observations. We are consistently ranked as one of the most accurate weather forecasting services in the world.</p>
