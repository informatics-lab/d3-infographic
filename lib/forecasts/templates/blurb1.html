<h2>Millions of people and organisations use our forecasts every day</h2>
<p>It's more than likely that you have seen a Met Office weather forecast via BBC television, the shipping forecast or our app and website.</p>

<p>The Met Office weather forecasting system is also run by many other countries on their supercomputers.</p>

<p>Private weather foreasters do not run their own physical weather forecasts. Instead they take the output of the Met Office forecast, and combine them with others to create a derived forecast.</p>
