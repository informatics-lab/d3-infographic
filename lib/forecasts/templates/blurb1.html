<h2>Over 100 million people use our forecasts every day and more than ten countries around the world use Met Office systems</h2>

<p>Millions of people and organisations use our forecasts every day and you have probably seen a Met Office forecast through our own apps and website, or through somebody else's web or app (e.g. BBC).</p>

<p>In fact, the Met Office provides data and expertise to commercial forecasting organisations that (like our own forecasters) further process our data to generate useful information to users.</p>

<p>And it is not only our data, our forecasting systems are considered one of the best in the world, and numerous countries (e.g. Australia, South Korea, India) run our systems to generate forecasts for their own citizens.</p>
