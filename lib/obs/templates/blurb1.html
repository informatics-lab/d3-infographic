<h2>Every day we gather more than 17 million observations</h2>
<p>From forecasters launching weather balloons in Antartica (thanks Laura!) to satellites measuring the top of the atmosphere, every day we collect over 17 million observations at the Met Office to start our forecasting process.</p>

<p>These observations are a critical step and are taken as part of an international collaboration with other Met services. We use weather stations, ocean buoys, civil aircraft, weather balloons, human observers and even seals (yes, really).</p>
