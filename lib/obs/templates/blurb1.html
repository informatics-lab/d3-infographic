<h2>Every day, the Met Office uses more than 7,000,000 weather observations</h2>
<p>This morning at 9AM, a weather observer like Laura went outside to measure the weather in Antarctica. They sent them to the Met Office in Exeter, where we use them to start our forecasts.</p>

<p>We need to know what the atmosphere is doing now to run a good forecast. Everytime we make a forecast, we use more than 7,000,000 measurements of the weather now.</p>

<p>These measurements are taken by national met services, such as the Met Office, all over the world. We use weather stations, ocean buoyes, civil aircraft, weather balloons, and even seals (yes, really).</p>
